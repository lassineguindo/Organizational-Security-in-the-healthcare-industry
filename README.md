# Organizational Security in the Healthcare Industry


## Project Overview
This project explores **organizational security in the healthcare industry**, focusing on protecting sensitive patient data, ensuring compliance with regulations, and reducing cyber threats. It covers key security measures such as **access control, password policies, disabling unnecessary services, and port management**.

## Presentation Topics
This project addresses four critical areas of healthcare security:

### 1️⃣ User Restrictions & Access Control
- **Risks**: Unauthorized access to **electronic health records (EHRs)**, insider threats, and data breaches.
- **Policies**:
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Limit user permissions based on job roles.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Require additional verification for access.
  - **Regular Audits** – Monitor access logs to prevent misuse.
- **Justification**: Strong access controls enhance **compliance with FERPA** and reduce security risks.

### 2️⃣ Password Standards & Requirements
- **Recent Breach Example**: In 2024, **Mercy Health Hospital** suffered a **data breach** due to weak passwords, exposing **2.5 million patient records**.
- **Policy Implementation**:
  - Passwords must be **at least 12 characters** and include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
  - Enforce **password updates every 90 days**.
  - Require **MFA for critical system access**.
- **Challenges**:
  - Resistance from healthcare staff to frequent password changes.
  - Potential access delays caused by MFA requirements.

### 3️⃣ Disabling Unnecessary Services
- **Risks**: Open and unused services can be exploited by attackers.
- **Examples of Unnecessary Services**:
  - **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** left enabled without security.
  - **Unused database services** running on healthcare servers.
- **Strategy**:
  - Conduct **regular service audits** to identify inactive services.
  - **Disable or remove** unnecessary services.
  - **Monitor & patch** services that must remain active.

### 4️⃣ Closing Unnecessary Ports
- **Importance**: Open ports create **potential entry points for cyber threats**.
- **Vulnerable Ports**:
  - **Port 3389 (RDP)** – Common target for remote access attacks.
  - **Port 21 (FTP)** – Vulnerable to **brute-force attacks**.
- **Security Plan**:
  - Use **network scanning tools** to identify open ports.
  - **Close or restrict access** to unused ports.
  - **Implement firewall rules** to control traffic and prevent breaches.

## Conclusion
Healthcare organizations must implement **comprehensive security measures** to:
- Protect **patient data** and prevent breaches.
- Ensure **compliance with healthcare regulations** (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA).
- Reduce cyber threats by **enhancing access control, enforcing strong password policies, disabling unnecessary services, and managing ports securely**.
